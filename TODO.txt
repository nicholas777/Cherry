Scripting Engine
# Calling c# from c++
# Calling c++ from c#
# Attaching c# to entities
# C# api
# Hot reloading
# Editing fields in editor

Minor improvments
- Profiling in the scripting engine
- Create systems for paths (not just "assets/" or "../Cherry/src/")
- Rewrite GetMousePos() functions
- Give all entities transform z component to determine rendering order
- Rework viewport resize code
- Show camera location in editor
- Support for editing script fields in editor of types UInt, Short, UShort, Long, ULong, Byte

Bug fixes
# Camera component viewpoint is offset
- When zooming in editor zooms towards the bottom of the screen
- When resetting texture params you need to reapply the texture to all objects using it
- If textures are loaded with more channels than they actually have, engine crashes (ex. RGB loaded as RGBA)
- Lagspike on second frame of runtime
- Running winGenProjects.bat doesn't include ScriptLib in Project solution
